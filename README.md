# Steps involved in the project:
 * Requirement Scoping
 * Data Collection in JSON file.
 * Data Cleaning and Preprocessing in Pandas using jupyter note book.
 * Data Transformation in Power Query
 * Data Modelling and Building Parameters in Power BI using DAX
 * Building the Dashboard in Power BI

# Data Collection:
Collected all the data tables in JSON file from google dataset search.

# Data Preprocessing:
 Performed initial data cleaning and preprocessing to correct the player names, handle missing value, match id linking etc using Pandas in Jupyter notebook and converted the JSON files into CSV files.
